    <h1>How is mead made?</h1>
    <p>Mead is made up of simple ingredeants, they are listed below</p>
    <!-- an unorganized list -->
    <ul>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To get started you warm up a little less than 3/4 of a gallon of water, you then mix around 4 pounds of honey into the water. once the honey and water are compleatly mixed and are as one, you must prime the yeast, to do this you mix one yeast packet with around a tablespoon of the solution of honey and water, it is important to make sure the solution is cooled a little before mixing the yeast, if a hot solution is introduced to the yeast, the yeast will die. </p>
